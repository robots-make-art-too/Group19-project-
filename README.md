# Group-project-
Hello welcome to EECS1720 group 19 our group name is AMJJR Creative Art.We're going to try to do something interesting and artistic AR code.
We are going to do the AR animation of different fish can be switched through the bottom icon switch to generate AR effect on the mobile phone.
The AR animation of different fish can be switched through the bottom icon switch to generate AR effect on the mobile phone.
Capture the life scene through the camera (using the framework AVFoundation), load the 3D model file using the SceneKit framework.  
Step 1. Implement two protocols  
1.AV Capture Metadata Output Objects Delegate  
2.UI Navigation Controller Delegat  
Step 2. Create a capture device object 
step 3. Create an input and output device object  
Step 4. Create a session scene add input and output device objects to the session scene 
step 5.  Create a preview view object to display the image captured by the camera  
The scene is then created to render the 3D model  
Step-1. Create a dedicated view for rendering 3D models 
step-2. Create a camera node object 
step-3. for observing 3D scenes.  Configure 3D view 
step-4. Create a method to add 3D models to the scene  
Finally, create gravity sensing object, detect the change of mobile phone Angle, generate AR image
